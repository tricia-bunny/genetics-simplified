You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles 
from your nice warm bed
You just remember what your old pal said
Boy, you've got a friend in me
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You got troubles, and I got 'em too
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
We stick together, we see it through
'Cause you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me

Some other folks might be a little bit 
smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too, maybe
But none of them will ever love you the way I do
It's me and you

And as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see it's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
